## My process
### Build with:
* Semantic HTML5 markup
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Pokemon API
* Ajax
* Fetch polyfill
* Promise polyfill
* UI pattern of Bootstrap
    * Modal 
    * Navbar 


### What I learned 
I learned how to estabish modal as centered on the screen, contain 3 elements of title, image, and height. Adding button element as function closing the modal, pressing the escape key, or clicking outside the modal. Last, I learn how to use Immediately invoked function expressions to be isolated variable declarations.
